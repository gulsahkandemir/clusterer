Clusterer
=========

The aim of this project is to cluster the search results of a given search engine (e.g. Bing, Google) in real-time using Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm on result snippets (small descriptions of the results). At the end, the project showed that STC is an effective algorithm in clustering web search results. The clusters were relevantly populated and their names were informative as well. The user could understand the content of a cluster at a glance.
